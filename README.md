Professional README Generator

This application allows users to easily generate a README file by using the command line. README's are useful for developers to showcase their projects and include a Title, Description, Instructions for use, contributions, tests, and contact information.

To use this application, clone the repo, cd into develop, and run node js. This will prompt you with questions and then generate a professional README.
